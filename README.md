# Mimetic cells

This repo contains scripts used to analyze scATAC-seq, bulk and scRNA-seq, and CUT&Tag data from Michelson et al, Cell, 2022. Most of the analyses were performed using excellent tools developed by others, including SnapATAC, chromVAR and macs2 for scATAC-seq; Seurat and scVelo for scRNA-seq; edgeR for RNA-seq; and deeptools, SEACR and HOMER for CUT&Tag. All have excellent documentation and tutorials that may be helpful for further analysis of this data.
